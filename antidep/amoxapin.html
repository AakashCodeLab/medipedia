It works by restoring the balance of natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain. Because amoxapine has some effects that are similar to those of major tranquilizers, it may work better in patients who have

<p>
 Amoxapine is used in the treatment of major <font color="red" style="text-shadow:4px 4px 4px #aaa;">depressive disorder</font>. Compared to other antidepressants it is believed to 
 have a faster onset of action, with therapeutic effects seen within four to seven days. In excess of 80% of patients
 that do respond to amoxapine are reported to respond within a fortnight of the beginning of treatment. 
 It also has properties similar to those of the <font color="red" style="text-shadow:4px 4px 4px #aaa;">typical antipsychotics</font>, and may behave as one and may be used in
 the treatment of <font color="red" style="text-shadow:4px 4px 4px #aaa;">schizophrenia </font>off-label. Despite its apparent lack of extrapyramidal side effects in patients 
 with schizophrenia it has been found to exacerbate motor symptoms in patients with<font color="red" style="text-shadow:4px 4px 4px #aaa;">
 Parkinson's</font> disease psychosis.
